# 1. Title: Ecommerce Sales Report Dashboard - Power BI

## 2. Executive Summary
The Ecommerce Sales Report Dashboard provides an end-to-end view of sales, profit, quantity, and customer behavior derived from two datasets namely Details and Orders. The organization lacked visibility into sales performance, profit distribution, and payment preferences across states and product categories.
